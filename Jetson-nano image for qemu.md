# Build Jetson-nano image for qemu.

Building Jetson-nano image for qemu in order to have full no-hardware solution.

Here's a general outline of the process to build a Jetson Nano image for QEMU:

**1. Set up the development environment:**
- Install Ubuntu or a compatible Linux distribution on your development machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies, including QEMU, Docker, and other required tools.

**2. Download and Set up Hardware Acceleration for Emulator Performance:**
-  Go to https://github.com/intel/haxm , Install and set up haxm.

**3. Go to Program and Fetures in Control Panel and turn off Hyper-V, Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Hypervision Platform.**

**4. Download the Jetson Nano SD card image:**
   - Obtain the official Jetson Nano SD card image from the NVIDIA website or other trusted sources. Make sure you download   the image compatible with your Jetson Nano model.

3. Extract the image contents:
- Use a tool like `7-Zip` or the `dd` command to extract the contents of the downloaded image file. You should end up with a `.img` file.

**5. Convert the image format:**
- Convert the extracted `.img` file to the `qcow2` format, which is compatible with QEMU. You can use the `qemu-img` tool for this purpose:
```qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 input.img output.qcow2 ```

**6. Configure the image:**
- Mount the `qcow2` image as a loop device using the `losetup` command:
     ```sudo losetup -fP --show output.qcow2 ```
- Mount the loop device to a directory:
     ```sudo mount /dev/loopX /mnt  ```
- Enter the mounted directory:
     ```cd /mnt```

- Modify any necessary configurations or install additional software within the image. This step will depend on your specific requirements.

**7. Unmount the image:**
- Unmount the mounted directory:
     ``` sudo umount /mnt  ```
- Detach the loop device:
     ``` sudo losetup -d /dev/loopX  ```

**8. Run the image with QEMU:**
- Launch the Jetson Nano image with QEMU, ensuring to pass the necessary parameters:
 ```
    qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -m 4G -smp 4 -nographic -kernel <path-to-vmlinuz> -initrd <path-to-initrd.img> -append "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/vda2 rw rootwait fsck.repair=yes memtype=0 video=tegrafb no_console_suspend=1 earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0x03100000 nvdumper_reserved=0x2772e0000 gpt tegra_fbmem=0x800000@0x92cb6000 lut_mem=0x2008@    0x92cb2000 usbcore.old_scheme_first=1 tegraid=19.1.2.0.0 maxcpus=4 boot.slot_suffix= boot.ratchetvalues=0.2.1 vpr_resize sdhci_tegra.en_boot_part_access=1" -drive format=qcow2,file=output.qcow2
```

_Please note that building a Jetson Nano image for QEMU might have some limitations or differences compared to running it on actual hardware. 
It's recommended to refer to the official NVIDIA documentation or community resources for more detailed and up-to-date instructions tailored to your specific use case._
