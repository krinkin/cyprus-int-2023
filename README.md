## Duckietown port to ROS2

Abstract: Duckietown platform rely on ROS. But ROS does not support real-time communication, which is crucial in multi-node and multi-robot environments and does not support data transfer control in distributed systems. The aim of this project is to port Duckietown software to ROS2 to achieve the following:
Real-time communication
Multi-robot systems (in city scenarios)
Better performance even for RPi variant.
Quality of Service (QoS) settings for publishers and subscribers: This allows developers to specify the service quality they need from the underlying middleware. This can be particularly useful in systems with real-time requirements, or where network bandwidth is limited.

### Outcome
  * ROS2 duckietown port MVP
  * Collateral outcome: Research paper for IROS or ICRA

### Collateral projects

  * CI/CD Robotics pipeline
  * Collateral Project: Convenient duckietown simulator with good physics

### Rules of the game
